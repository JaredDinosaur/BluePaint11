Thank you for using BluePaint11!
It is strongly recommended to only run these scripts in a virtual machine.
Run the scripts in numbered order, starting with Phase 1.
dl-execti.html is used to download ExecTI, which is required to run the scripts.
FallbackTaskManager.cmd opens the Windows 10 Task Manager, as the Windows 11 task manager stops rendering correctly after Phase 1.
***PLEASE READ THE WARNINGS BEFORE EXECUTING EACH SCRIPT!!!***
